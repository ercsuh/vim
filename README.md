`.vimrc`: Erica's vim configuration file!

To personalize vim settings in a new bash terminal, perform the following steps.

1. `vim .vimrc`
2. Copy contents from this github repo's `.vimrc` into the `.vimrc` you just opened in your terminal.
3. Get [Tim Pope's Pathogen](https://gist.github.com/romainl/9970697).
4. Clone [this repo](https://github.com/sjl/badwolf/) into `~/.vim/bundle` to use the badwolf colorscheme.
